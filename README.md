# zoneproxy [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/detailyang/zoneproxy.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/detailyang/zoneproxy)[![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/detailyang/zoneproxy.svg)](https://github.com/detailyang/zoneproxy/releases)[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/detailyang/zoneproxy/master/LICENSE)
zoneproxy easy to access different network zones

#purpose
zoneproxy aims to solve the problem in the actual scene, i want to access the server on the different network zones, but our cloud environment only allow me to access the one server called jumpserver. if i want to access more servers, only add a static route on my route table everytime, which is not too convenient:(. Finally, i set socks5 server on each jumpserver and install proxy (tcpproxy„ÄÅhttp reverse proxy and http forward proxy)in the office and i just control the link from my office to another zones. architecture as follow:

#install
you have two ways to get binary, choose the best way and enjoy it.

1. choose download binary package
2. compile source code

#build
make sure you have install go:)
````bash
git clone https://github.com/detailyang/zoneproxy
cd zoneproxy
make install #to install deps
make build #build binary
````

#run
##zoneproxy
look at the config file, wish it's easy to understand:)

````bash
#we use the glog module, it's not firendly to log:(, now just send stdout
bin/zoneproxy -logtostderr=true  -config conf/proxy.json
````
##socks5
socks5 config is easy to understand, i guess.
````javascript
{
    "address": ":9999",
    "username": "hello",
    "password": "jack"
}
````
run the socks5 in your server
````bash
bin/socks5 -logtostderr=true -config=conf/socks5.json
````
#todo
1. better logging
2. better config file fault tolerance
3. provide api to monitor
4. add test code


#finally
it's done , but not perfect. i took two days to write this, i know it's not enough good but it can be used to solve my problem in the actual scene.

i'm ensure that i will update code  and check the issues if anyone have any problem.

welcome to send pull requests to fix bugs:)
